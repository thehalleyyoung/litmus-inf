;
; Sorts:
;   Int — event timestamps (topological ordering for acyclicity)
;   Int — read-from values (index into per-address store list)
;   Bool — coherence order relation (total order on stores per address)
;
; Relations encoded:
;   po  — program order (model-dependent preservation)
;   rf  — read-from (which store each load reads)
;   co  — coherence order (total order on stores per address)
;   fr  — from-reads (derived: load reads from s_i, s_j co-after s_i)
;
; Safety property:
;   UNSAT ⟹ forbidden outcome unreachable under model (SAFE)
;   SAT   ⟹ forbidden outcome reachable (UNSAFE, witness provided)
;
; Memory model: OpenCL-Dev
; Pattern: rel_acq_chain
; Forbidden outcome: {"r0": 1, "r1": 1, "r2": 0}

; Axiomatic memory model framework (Alglave, Maranget, Tautschnig 2014)
;
; An execution X = (E, po, rf, co) where:
;   E   = set of memory events (reads/writes with addresses and values)
;   po  = program order (per-thread total order on events)
;   rf  = read-from function mapping each read to the write it reads
;   co  = coherence order (per-address total order on writes)
;   fr  = from-reads: derived as rf^{-1}; co
;
; A memory model M defines which executions are consistent via
; acyclicity constraints on combinations of these relations.
;
; Models encoded:
;   TSO   — acyclic(po ∪ rf ∪ co ∪ fr), po relaxes W→R only
;   PSO   — additionally relaxes W→W
;   ARM   — relaxes all cross-address po except deps and fences
;   RISC-V — like ARM with asymmetric fence.{pred}.{succ}
;   GPU    — like ARM with scoped fences (workgroup/device/system)
;
; Encoding strategy:
;   Acyclicity is encoded via integer timestamps:
;   For each event e, ts(e) ∈ ℤ with ts(a) < ts(b) for each preserved edge a→b.
;   A cycle exists iff the conjunction of all ts constraints is unsatisfiable.
;   We conjoin the forbidden outcome constraint and check satisfiability.
